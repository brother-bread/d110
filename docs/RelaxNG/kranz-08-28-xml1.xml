    <info>[Letter from Marian Baldwin, June 30, 1917]</info>

    <place>On Board La Touraine,</place>

    <time>June 30th, 1917.</time>

    <p>Even now that we are out of sight of land, it seems impossible that I am actually off to
            <place>France</place> and, for the first time in my life, traveling alone.
            <context>Everything has happened so quickly since the American Fund for French Wounded
            found an opening for me in <place>Paris</place> that I suppose I am still somewhat dazed
            and bewildered.</context> The fact that I don't know what it will all be like and that I
        can't look ahead makes it easier to be happy and live in the present. Of course I have had a
        bit of a taste in <place>New York</place> of the work that the A. F. F. W. is doing but its
        Headquarters in <place>Paris</place> will be different in some ways I fancy.</p>

    <p>I can't get over how lucky I am to have this chance for <context>I realize how few girls of
            my age are getting across</context>, and I understood the grit and pluck which made you
        encourage me on my great adventure and send me along a path which has proved so dangerous of
        late.</p>

    <p><desc>As we drifted down the river, in the sunset glow with two absurd tugs puffing
            alongside, I know that many eyes were moist and that the same thought was in all our
            minds.</desc> How many of this ship's company will see that sky-line again! It was very
        quiet, no one spoke much, and, little by little, <desc>the glow faded from the sky and one
            star after another appeared.</desc> I knew that you would be looking at those same stars
        down in <place>Lakewood</place> and that your thoughts and prayers were the same that filled
        my heart at that moment. Somehow distance does not separate, after all.</p>

    <p>We waited near the <place>Statue of Liberty</place> until midnight—a rumor had it that a
        "personage" was to come on board. This individual was shrouded in mystery until we put to
        sea when it was given out that the party which had clambered aboard in the night was none
        other than the Italian Mission. Our spirits rose at once for, what with Frank Sayre on the
        boat and these distinguished Italian gentlemen, we shall doubtless be honored by a bigger
        convoy and so doubly safe. However, thus far we have but two destroyers following us.
            <desc>They can be seen distinctly outlined against the horizon, one on each side, and
            seem to be the same somber gray which all ships are affecting in this war. </desc>
        <desc>A sailor informed me this morning that we weren't in much danger for the first four or
            five days but that after that I might see some excitement. Here's hoping! </desc></p>

    <p><desc>I have a small inside cabin and my room-mate is quite a character.</desc>
        <desc>She is a native of <place>Haiti</place>, voluble and very portly—has four large pieces
            of baggage in our tiny stateroom, wears a costume which resembles a Mother Hubbard and
            smokes countless thin cigarettes that smell like incense!</desc> When I appeared, there
        didn't seem to be much room for me but, as she says, luckily I am small, and I was soon
        tucked into the upper berth with my belongings! She really isn't bad and after looking me
        over carefully told me that she didn't think we would fight and from that time has beamed
        upon me! <desc>She is going over to join her son who has been fighting with the French since
            the beginning of the war but will never go back to the Front now, having lost some
            fingers off each hand.</desc> She is so thankful, she says, that he hasn't lost more
        than his fingers. </p>

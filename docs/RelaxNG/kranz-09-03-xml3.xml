    <dsone>Dark Souls <p n="1" info="background"><chrct type="major">Sir Artorias</chrct> was
            one of the knights at the service of <chrct type="major">Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight</chrct>
            and, thanks to his unmatched skill with a greatsword and unbendable will of steel[1], he
            became one of Gwyn's most trusted warriors and was rewarded with a fragment of Gwyn's
            powerful Lord Soul[2]. Along with <chrct type="major">Ornstein</chrct>, <chrct
                type="minor">Ciaran</chrct> and <chrct type="minor">Gough</chrct>, he became part of
            the <chrct type="major">Four Knights of Gwyn</chrct> and as a symbol of his association
            with the order he gained a magical ring with the wolf symbol, which strengthened his
            poise, making his fighting style with his greatsword more effective[1].</p>
        <p n="2" info="artorias">Artorias wore his distinctive azure-blue tassel armor as a
            symbol of pride and glory[3] and brandished his Greatsword[4] and Greatshield[5].
            Artorias was also a dear friend of Ciaran, his companion as another Knight of Gwyn[6].
            At a certain point Artorias met <chrct type="minor">Sif</chrct>, a great grey wolf, and
            formed a deep bond with it, fighting alongside the fearsome animal like he was his
            companion[7] to the point that the wolf learned to fight with his greatsword and
            acquired the power of Artorias' soul[8][9][10].</p>
        <p n="3" info="abyss">At some point after Lord Gwyn sacrificed himself to link the
            fading First Flame, the <chrct type="major">Primordial Serpent Kaathe</chrct> began
            searching for a human strong enough to become the Dark Lord capable of leading humans
            and usher in an <concept type="major">Age of Dark</concept>[11]. At some point <chrct
                type="minor">Kaathe</chrct> arrived in new Londo and managed to seduce the Four
            Kings, powerful humans who had received a fragment of Gwyn's <item type="major">Lord
                Soul</item>[12], to follow his ideals, teaching them the art of Lifedrain so that
            they could preserve their humanity even while Undead and so cast off the shackles placed
            upon them by the gods[13][14]. But his dark influence did not stop with the kings and in
            fact their entire army followed them. The knights of <place type="major">New
                Londo</place> became <chrct type="minor">Darkwraiths</chrct>[15], servants of the
            Dark who learned the art of Lifedrain and used it to absorb humanity[16]. As the Four
            Kings' were able to open an <concept type="major">Abyss</concept> in the center of their
            city, their very bodies were mutated by their freed Dark Soul and the Darkwraiths' armor
            transformed too[17] as they began to employ the <item type="minor">Red Eye Orbs</item>
            granted by Kaathe[18] to seek humanity and plunge further into the powers of the
            Dark[19],</p>
        <p n="4" info="abyss">A nation of humans freed from the shackles of the <concept
                type="major">Darksign</concept> and who not only began to understand the powers of
            their Dark Soul but had an entire army at their disposal that shared this power
            represented an unparalleled threat to the gods of <place type="major">Anor Londo</place>
            who branded the Darkwraiths as diabolical enemies of man and of every living
            thing[20][21]. For this reason Artorias, as one of the Four Knights of Gwyn, was sent to
            fight the dark soldiers of New Londo and was given a Silver Pendant to deflect the Dark
            of the Abyss in its magical forms[22]. However this did not prove sufficient to cross
            the Abyss of the Four Kings and Artorias was forced to forge a covenant with the "beasts
            of the Abyss"[23], obtaining a ring that would allow him to cross the Abyss but also
            cursing his sword in the process[24]. Artorias thus became known as the "<concept
                type="major">Abysswalker</concept>" and hunted the Darkwraiths[25] but failed to
            eliminate the <chrct type="major">Four Kings</chrct> and thus close the <place
                type="major">Abyss of New Londo</place>. Having failed to eliminate the dark threat,
            an agonizing and terrible decision was made: flooding the entire land of New Londo
            despite the realization that countless lives and the entire culture of the country would
            be lost[26]. For this task, sorcerers were called[27] and the feat was accomplished
            without even evacuating the city's civilians, sealing away the Four Kings, their
            Darkwraiths and the entire population with them, the victims were thus cursed[28] and
            became Ghosts roaming the ruins of their country[29].</p>
        <p n="5" info="abyss">After his failure with the Four Kings[30]., the Primordial
            Serpent Kaathe arrived in <place type="major">Oolacile</place> and manipulated the
            country to upturn the grave of <chrct type="major">Manus</chrct>, a primordial man with
            an extraordinary <concept type="major">Dark Soul</concept>[31] and dark sorcery
            skills[32][33], that had been buried beneath the dungeons of their city and resurrect
            him[34][35]. However, the royal family of Oolacile took the precious broken pendant of
            Manus for themselves, giving it to <chrct type="minor">Princess Dusk</chrct>[36]. The
            wrenching nostalgia connected to his object of obsession and the sincere hope to reclaim
            it[37] drove Manus mad and his Dark Soul went wild, transforming him into a dark beast
            eternally seeking his pendant[38]. His immense mass of humanity out of control led to
            the manifestation of an Abyss that spread, threatening to devour the entire land[39].
            The Dark emanating from Manus did not limit itself to generating countless Humanity
            Phantoms with a will of their own but also influenced the residents of Oolacile, making
            their humanity go wild and horribly mutating their bodies, bloating their head and
            opening them with cracks lined with innumerable tiny red eyeballs and protuding brain
            parts[40].</p>
